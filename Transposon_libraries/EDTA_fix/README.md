# EDTA

A slightly modified version of util/gff2bed.pl from EDTA (https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA/). This modification will allow the script to assign a type to Penelope elements, thereby preventing the software to crash due to missing type for these elements. This has already been corrected in later versions of EDTA.
