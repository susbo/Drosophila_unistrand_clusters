# Genome assemblies

`make_indices.sh` is a wrapper script that uses `rename_chromosomes.pl` and `download_NCBI.pl`.

The `old_indices` folder contain https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all/index.html downloaded at the three separate timepoints (2020-10-17, 2021-10-20, and 2022-04-26). These are the assemblies used in the study.
